# ArtThoughts
This is a very bare bones pinterest-like application meant for cataloging artistic ideas and contributing thoughts to those ideas.


## Installation

Clone down the repo
```
git clone 
cd art-thoughts
```
Once in the project directory, use two terminals in your editor to open the backend and frontend

For backend
```
cd art-thoughts-api
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
```
With the rails server running, open the index.html file in your browser.

For frontend
```
cd art-thoughts-client
explorer.exe index.html
```
